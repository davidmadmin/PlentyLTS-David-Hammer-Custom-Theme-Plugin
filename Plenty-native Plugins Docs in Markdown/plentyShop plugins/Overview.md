# plentyShop LTS \& IO

Our [Template guide](https://developers.plentymarkets.com/en-gb/developers/main/plentyshop-plugins/template-overview.html) is your entry point for developing for plentyShop.

If you're looking for changes between older Ceres versions and plentyShop LTS, the [Update guide](https://developers.plentymarkets.com/en-gb/developers/main/plentyshop-plugins/ceres-5-update.html) will prove useful.

We've also expanded the reference documentation on properties and methods used in [plentyShop LTS'](https://developers.plentymarkets.com/en-gb/plugin-ceres/5.0.0/index.html) and [IO's](https://developers.plentymarkets.com/en-gb/plugin-io/5.0.0/index.html) PHP classes.

## ShopBuilder

If you want to customise widgets or work on your own, you should begin with the [ShopBuilder tutorial](https://developers.plentymarkets.com/en-gb/developers/main/shopbuilder-plugins/shopbuilder-widgets.html).

## Community

If you have questions about developing plugins for the shop, you can get in touch with the rest of our developer community. Simply open a new topic in the [shop category](https://help.plentyone.com/hc/en-gb/community/topics/27021876313746-Shop) or create a support ticket. The PlentyONE team may join the discussion as well, but depending on the complexity of the issue, it might take a few days.

## You want to contribute?

The plugins plentyShop LTS and IO are open source. If you want to contribute to our projects, you'll find a handy [contribution guide](https://github.com/plentymarkets/plugin-ceres/blob/stable/contributionGuide.md) in the plentyShop LTS plugin repository.

## plentyManual

If you're looking for user documentation instead of dev-docs, you will find it in our [plentyManual](https://knowledge.plentymarkets.com/). The pages on [setting up plentyShop LTS](https://knowledge.plentymarkets.com/en/slp/webshop/ceres-einrichten) and [working with ShopBuilder](https://knowledge.plentymarkets.com/en/online-store/shop-builder) are great entry points.
